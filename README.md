Alfieri: a molecular modelling pipeline to score and rank protein-DNA interactions.

I developed a molecular modeling pipeline of for (4) consecutive steps in order to score and rank protein-DNA interactions.

Please read the file readme.pdf to have some information about the pipeline. The scripts can be found in the directory scripts. The procedure to use the scripts can be found in the file procedure.txt. Two files are missing: aminodna.dat and dfire_DNA179. They are used for the evaluation of the free-energy of binding with DDNA and they are part of that software.




Volli, e volli sempre, e fortissimamente volli.
